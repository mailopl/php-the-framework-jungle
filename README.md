PHP: The framework jungle
=========================

> phpjungle.org tells you, how to do **X** thing in **Y** framework 
### What and how? ###

There's no Rails for PHP. 

There's Symfony2, ZF2, CakePHP, Yii, Kohana, CodeIgniter, Laravel... and the list goes on. 

What do <strong>ALL</strong> of these frameworks have in common ? <b>Scenarios</b> in which you will use them

For example, <b>user authentication</b>. It doesn't matter if you use Symfony2 or Laravel, if you need some 
badass authentication - you can do it in any of them.

This site is build to help you spot differences between frameworks.
How does REST look like in CakePHP ? How does it differ in  Symfony? 

We hope you find a way out of this jungle and pick a framework that best suits your needs and sense of aesthetics.
