PHP: The framework jungle

When it comes to Ruby and mainstream frameworks, there's Rails. 
When it comes to PHP and mainstream frameworks, there's Symfony2, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, ZendFramework2, Yii, Laravel... and the list goes on.

What do all of these frameworks have in common ? MVC ? No, we can hardly speak about MVC, it would be rather MVP, but then for example Symfony2 is a request-response framework.

Scenarios in which you will use them are common, for all of the frameworks.

Doesn't matter if you use Symfony2 or CakePHP, if you have to authenticate the user, you have to do it - period. 
And any of these frameworks will let you do it. The thing is, that some of them can do it faster, nicer or generally speaking better (for you).

Feel free to pick up a scenario and see how particular framework can handle it!
